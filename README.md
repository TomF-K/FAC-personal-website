# FAC-personal-website
Personal website for FAC bootcamp application

This site is designed to show some of the skills that I've learned over the past year of studying online courses. 

I have tried to make the HTML markup as semantic as possible to aid accessibility and avoid the dreaded 'div soup'. CSS Grid and Flexbox have been used where possible to make the pages responsive on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
