Personal portfolio website

This site is designed to show some of the skills that I've learned over the past two years from studying online courses and practical work experience:

• Semantic HTML
• Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
• Interactive elements using vanilla JS
• Projects showcasing use of React, Vite, and Node
